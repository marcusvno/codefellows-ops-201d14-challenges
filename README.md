# Codefellows Ops Challenges 
### What is this repo all about?
Welcome to my Code Fellows Ops Challenges! A repository hold all my accumulated scripts learned during the 201 Foundations of Computer Operation course. 
### Why are you learning these skills?
In the Ops Challenges, I learned to script in both Bash and PowerShell so to have a fundamental understanding of the automation tools available to me for use in the cybersecurity and devops industry.
### What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
As part of these scripting challenges, we covered development fundamentals such as loops, conditional statements, and basic Linux and PowerShell commands.
### What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
Creating custom menus with multiple selectable options which executed different commands was my favorite assignment as it helped build a basic understanding of how to make my own command line tools in the future.
### How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
Shell scripting could be used for automating repetitive tasks, whether creating multiple files and folder structures, or setting up new virtual machine to have the proper permissions, ports opened, or even software installed. 
### What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
The multi-tool scripts and the Windows PowerShell setup so that any time I want to wipe a Windows machine clean I can set it up to my desire specifications easily and efficiently. 
### What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
The scripts were used were basic. I'd like to improve on developing more involved and complex tools for use in the future. (Such as the Windows Debloater tool)
