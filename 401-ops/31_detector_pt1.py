#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Prompt the user to type in a file name to search for.
#   - Prompt the user for a directory to search in.
#   - Search each file in the directory by name.
#       TIP: You may need to perform different commands depending on what OS youâ€™re executing the script on.
#   - For each positive detection, print to the screen the file name and location.
#   - # At the end of the search process, print to the screen how many files were searched and how many hits were found.
#
#   - The script must successfully execute on both Linux and Windows.
